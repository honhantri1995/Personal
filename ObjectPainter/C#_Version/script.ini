; Following cause invalid syntax,
; --> a message box with clear message will notify user why and where the script is wrong
; 1. Duplicate object IDs. Eg: there are two [object_1] found
; 2. (x, y), width, height is negative numbers. Eg: x0 = -200, or height = -100
; 3. (x, y), width, height is not number. Eg: x0 = abc, or width = 130x
; 4. Shape type is not one of these: rectangle, triangle, line, ellipse
; 5. Color is not one of these: red, green, blue, black, brown
; 6. Lack of attribute for drawing a shape. Eg: rectangle has no height, or line has only one point
